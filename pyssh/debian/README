Building Debian packages
=================================================
Distutils does not support building Debian packages. This 
directory contains debian packaging files that support
building binary packages compatible with Debian Python
releases.

PySSH .deb files must be built for the specific version(s)
of python installed. To do so, change the PYTHON= line in 
debian/rules:

PYTHON=[python interpretor]

to use the versioned python interpretor supplied by the Debian
Python package then, either as root or using fakeroot run:

debian/rules binary

The package will then be created named:

python[python_version-pyssh_[pyssh_version]_[arch].deb

Note that PYTHON=python

will build a .deb for whichever version of Python is your
default.

EXAMPLE
If you want a pyssh .deb for Python 2.3, change the PYTHON= 
line to:

PYTHON=python2.3

Then run:

fakeroot debian/rules binary

For PySSH 0.3, this will produce the file "python2.3-pyssh_0.3_i386.deb"
